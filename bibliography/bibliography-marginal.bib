Specifically, ideographs evaluatively categorized while performing isometric upper arm flexion were subsequently preferred to ideographs evaluatively categorized while performing isometric upper arm extension. The present research sought to replicate this attitudinal effect with semantic stimuli and to examine a theoretical boundary condition posited by the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Subjects categorized either neutral words or pronounceable nonwords while adopting the isometric positions. Results indicated that motor processes influenced subsequent attitudes toward stimuli with few associations (i.e., nonwords) more than toward stimuli with many associations in memory (i.e., familiar words). These results are consistent with a growing literature on the possible influence of nondeclarative (e.g., procedural) knowledge on attitudes.},

  title = {An Ethical Approach to Peeking at Data},
  volume = {9},
  abstract = {When  data  analyses  produce  encouraging  but  nonsignificant  results,  researchers  often  respond  by  collecting  more  
data. This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the 
Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate 
the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, 
the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum 
p
 value within the initial sample such 
that  the  dataset  would  be  augmented.  With  one  round  of  augmentation,  Type  I  error  inflation  maximizes  at  .0975  
with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical 
value to allow augmentation while maintaining 
p
 $<$ .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For 
the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, 
p
augmented
, that represents the 
magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation. We argue that the disclosure of post-hoc dataset augmentation via 
p
augmented
 elevates such augmentation from a questionable research practice to an ethical research decision.},

In Experiments 1 and 2, affective-mapping effects predicted by specific-muscle-activation and distance-regulation accounts were replicated when the standard response labels towards and away were used but were reversed when identical lever movements were labeled downwards and upwards. In Experiment 3, affective-mapping effects were produced with affectively labeled right and left lever movements that are intrinsically unrelated to approach and avoidance. Experiments 4 and 5 revealed that affective-mapping effects are not mediated by memory retrieval processes and depend on the execution of affectively coded responses. The results support the assumption that evaluative implications of action instructions assign affective codes to motor responses on a representational level that interact with stimulus evaluations on a response selection stage.},

  abstract = {This article presents a meta-analysis of research on the affective compatibility effect: the relative facilitation of arm flexion and extension movements, in response to positive and negative stimuli, respectively. Across 68 effect sizes (computed on 3169 participants), a small, significant average compatibility effect emerged (ES = .118; 95\% CI [.051, .185]). Importantly, analyses also revealed significant heterogeneity in the set of effect sizes. Moderator analyses were conducted to explain this observed heterogeneity with a view to testing between extant theoretical accounts of the compatibility effect. Affective compatibility effects were significantly larger (1) for face stimuli than for words or pictorial stimuli; (2) when the negative stimuli partly comprising the effect were anger-related; (3) for responses made using vertical button press; (4) when situated aspects of the processing task framed flexion as approach and extension as avoidance; and (5) when explicit response labels framed flexion as positive and extension as negative. Significant reverse compatibility effects emerged (1) when aspects of the processing context framed flexion as avoidance and extension as approach and (2) when explicit response labels framed flexion as negative and extension as positive. The results of the meta-analysis provide little support for the strong embodiment, specific muscle activation account of affective compatibility and are broadly consistent with distance regulation, and, in particular, evaluative coding accounts.},

  abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that
would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm
that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can
disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building
multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform
partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep
the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider
(or, equivalently, adjusting the
p
values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel
models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in
settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

tatistical  training  helps  individuals  analyze  and  interpret  data.  However,  the  emphasis  placed  on  null
hypothesis significance testing in academic training and reporting may lead researchers to interpret evidence
dichotomously rather than continuously. Consequently, researchers may either disregard evidence that fails to
attain  statistical  significance  or  undervalue  it  relative  to  evidence  that  attains  statistical  significance.  Surveys
of researchers across a wide variety of fields (including medicine, epidemiology, cognitive science, psychology,
business, and economics) show that a substantial majority does indeed do so. This phenomenon is manifest both
in researchers' interpretations of descriptions of evidence and in their likelihood judgments. Dichotomization of
evidence is reduced though still present when researchers are asked to make decisions based on the evidence,
particularly when the decision outcome is personally consequential. Recommendations are offered.},

  abstract = {What was noted by E. J. Langer (1978) remains true today: that much of contemporary psychological research is based on the assumption that people are consciously and systematically processing incoming information in order to construe and interpret their world and to plan and engage in courses of action. As did Langer, the authors question this assumption. First, they review evidence that the ability to exercise such conscious, intentional control is actually quite limited, so that most of moment-to-moment psychological life must occur through nonconscious means if it is to occur at all. The authors then describe the different possible mechanisms that produce automatic, environmental control over these various phenomena and review evidence establishing both the existence of these mechanisms as well as their consequences for judgments, emotions, and behavior. Three major forms of automatic self-regulation are identified: an automatic effect of perception on action, automatic goal pursuit, and a continual automatic evaluation of one's experience. From the accumulating evidence, the authors conclude that these various nonconscious mental systems perform the lion's share of the self-regulatory burden, beneficently keeping the individual grounded in his or her current environment.},

  abstract = {Grounded cognition rejects traditional views that cognition is computation on amodal symbols in a modular system, independent of the brain's modal systems for perception, action, and introspection. Instead, grounded cognition proposes that modal simulations, bodily states, and situated action underlie cognition. Accumulating behavioral and neural evidence supporting this view is reviewed from research on perception, memory, knowledge, language, thought, social cognition, and development. Theories of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are origins of the area and common misperceptions of it. Theoretical, empirical, and methodological issues are raised whose future treatment is likely to affect the growth and impact of grounded cognition.},

Intuitive thoughts, like percepts, are highly accessible. Determinants and consequences of accessibility help explain the central results of prospect theory, framing effects, the heuristic process of attribute substitution, and the characteristic biases that result from the substitution of nonextensional for extensional attributes. Variations in the accessibility of rules explain the occasional corrections of intuitive judgments. The study of biases is compatible with a view of intuitive thinking and decision making as generally skilled and successful.},

  abstract = {In this data deposit, I describe a dataset that is the result of content mining 167,318 published articles for statistical test results reported according to the standards prescribed by the American Psychological Association (APA). Articles published by the APA, Springer, Sage, and Taylor \&amp; Francis were included (mining from Wiley and Elsevier was actively blocked). As a result of this content mining, 688,112 results from 50,845 articles were extracted. In order to provide a comprehensive set of data, the statistical results are supplemented with metadata from the article they originate from. The dataset is provided in a comma separated file (CSV) in long-format. For each of the 688,112 results, 20 variables are included, of which seven are article metadata and 13 pertain to the individual statistical results (e.g., reported and recalculated p-value). A five-pronged approach was taken to generate the dataset: (i) collect journal lists; (ii) spider journal pages for articles; (iii) download articles; (iv) add article metadata; and (v) mine articles for statistical results. All materials, scripts, etc. are available at https://github.com/chartgerink/2016statcheck\_data and preserved at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.59818.},
