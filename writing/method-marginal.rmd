##Method
###Sample
The sample consisted of a large number of p-values extracted from articles published by journals belonging to the American Psychological Association (APA) between 1985 - 2016. C. Hartgerink previously extracted 74,489 articles from different APA-journals between 1985-2016, which were used as a basis for the current project [@10.3390/data1030014]. Since only articles in HTML format were collected, the time span for data from any given journal depended on from what year articles in each journal were available in HTML format. In addition, though @10.3390/data1030014 collected data from several different publishers, only data from journals belonging to the APA was used in the current project due to ready access to this particular data. After cleaning (see 'data' section), the final sample consisted of 50,891 p-values, originating from 19,875 articles in 73 different journals.

###Data
Extracted data was cleaned, subfield categories added, and a subsample for testing and pre-registration purposes created (figure 1). From the articles provided by @10.3390/data1030014 790,206 p-values were extracted. According to @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2 the vast majority of researchers (94.3%) consider $p = .05$ as significant, and as such we limited our sample to $p > .05$. In addition, @10.1177/0956797616645672, in an subanalysis of the distribution of p-values, report a sharp drop in p-values reported as marginally significant above $p = .1$, and we therefore used as an upper limit $p <= .1$. Approximately 6.4% of all extracted p-values fell between these values ($.05 < p <= .1$). Prior to this process, we removed a small number of entries (1,124) from the dataset because of misreporting or extraction-failure, although this number does not include p-values that were misreported as too high (_e.g._ $p = 1.0$ instead of $p = .10$) or as possible p-values (_e.g._ $p = .99$ instead of $p = .099$). However, according to @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2, misreporting occurs for only about .97% of nonsignificant p-values (defined as $p > .05$). Our categorization of journals into different subfields is taken from the APA's ([www.apa.org](www.apa.org)) division of their journals into 'topics'. Note, however, that the APA allows the possibility of a journal belonging to several subfields. A full list of which journals were included in which subfields can be found in appendix A. Finally, a stratified random sample (by journal) was taken from the finished dataset. For a more detailed walkthrough of the data preparation, refer to appendix B.

###Analysis
We describe the percentage of p-values ($.05 < p <= .1$) reported as marginally significant in a population of APA journals, overall and by subfields. We extracted p-values and surrounding information from the full-text of 19,875 articles from 1985-2016. Due to the size and non-random nature of our sample we consider it our population of interest and report only descriptive statistics. To determine whether a result was reported as marginally significant, we searched the 200 characters preceding and succeeding a given p-value for strings containing "marginal" and "approach", and considered the p-value to be reported as marginally significant if either of those strings was found. For the analyses the extracted p-values were aggregated by subfield and overall. Finally, to facilitate interpretation we estimated linear trends and report regression coefficients, as well as proportion of variance explained.
