@10.1177/0956797616645672 have examined the incidence of articles reporting results as 'marginally' significant in psychology, and claim that the usage is becoming more prevalent. The researchers looked at the frequency with which articles report at least one result as 'marginally significant' or 'approaching significance', in a snapshot of articles from the journals 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental Psychology', and the 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology' (JPSP) for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. In total 1,535 articles were extracted, meant to "represent three major subfields of psychology: cognitive, developmental, and social" (p. 1037) over time. @10.1177/0956797616645672 concluded that the proportion of articles reporting results as marginally significant (or variations thereof) has risen considerably in all three journals over the time period 1970 to 2010. Moreover, they found that articles published in JPSP (representing social psychology) were the most likely to interpret results as marginally significant. 

The outcome variable of @10.1177/0956797616645672 is unfortunately flawed, motivating a re-examination of the researchers' claims. The outcome variable used was the proportion of papers reporting one or more results as marginally significant. However, if an article contains more p-values, then there are more possibilities for marginally significant results, and thus also a higher probability that the paper will contain at least one marginally significant result. It is problematic then, that this outcome measure does not take into account the fact that the total number of reported p-values per journal article has increased over the years [@10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2]. Consequently, even if the probability that a p-value is reported as 'marginally significant' stays the same, or is decreasing to a degree, newer articles will be more likely to contain at least one marginally significant result than older ones. Similarly, if articles in a certain journal on average contain more p-values, more papers in that journal will report at least one marginally significant result. Articles in JPSP contain almost twice as many p-values as those in 'Developmental Psychology' [@10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2], though data is not available on 'Cognitive Psychology'. Thus, using as an outcome variable the proportion of papers reporting at least one result as marginally significant provides little to no information on researchers' usage of the concept of marginal significance, neither over time nor across journals. In consequence, the current paper aims to re-examine @10.1177/0956797616645672 claims that 'marginally significant' results are the most prevalent in social psychology, and that they have become more prevalent over time in the three subfields of cognitive, social, and developmental psychology.

We extend the sample of journals and years to decrease (potential) sampling bias and avoid exclusion of important subfields. @10.1177/0956797616645672 examined an impressive number of articles (1,535) manually, however, using automated methods permits substantially larger sample sizes. For example, @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2 in their research extracted 5,108 articles from the JPSP, from the time period 1985-2013. Increasing sample size decreases the risk of sampling bias, as it is possible that editorial policies regarding marginal significance differ from the chosen journals and the journal population in general, or that examining a limited number of years leads to spurious results. In addition, increasing sample size permits inclusion of important subfields in psychology not previously examined, such as clinical, and experimental psychology. As such, we have chosen to extend the scope of the current article beyond replicating @10.1177/0956797616645672, by including all articles published between 1985-2016 in journals pertaining to the American Psychological Association (APA). Using this data we examine the prevalence over time of 'marginally significant' reporting in several subfields in psychology in addition to cognitive, social, and developmental psychology, as well as the prevalence in APA-journals overall.
