##Method
###Sample
The sample consisted of a large number of p-values extracted from articles published by journals belonging to the American Psychological Association (APA) between 1985 - 2016.  <!-- C. Hartgerink previously extracted 74,489 articles in HTML format from different APA-journals, which were used as a basis for the current project [@10.3390/data1030014]. Only articles available in HTML format were extracted, as the conversion of PDF-articles to plain text tends to not function well for automated reading. This data, however, is only available from 1985 onwards due to originally being extracted for use with the function 'statcheck'; statcheck requires reported statistics to be in APA-format, which has only been (mostly) consistent since 1985 according to @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2. Moreover, since only articles in HTML format were collected, the time span over which articles were downloaded from a specific journal depended on from what year articles in that journal were available in HTML format. Finally, only data from journals belonging to the APA was used in the current project, due to ease of access to this particular data. After cleaning (see 'data' section), the final sample consisted of 50,891 p-values, originating from 19,875 articles in 73 different journals. -->

###Data
Extracted data was cleaned, subfield categories added, and a subsample for testing and pre-registration purposes created.  <!-- For each article, the following information was extracted: Digital Object Identifier(where available), raw text of the p-values (_e.g._ "_p_=.048"), sign of the p-value comparison ('>','<' or '='), the p-value itself, and finally the 200 characters immediately before the reported p-value, and the 200 characters immediately following. This data was collated into one large dataset containing 790,206 entries. From this dataset a small number of entries (51) lacking identifying information were removed, and all rows where the p-values were not numerical (_e.g._ equal to '.'), due to misreporting or extraction-failure, were removed as missing values. There were 1073 such missing values in the extracted data, making up about .14% of the total. Note that this does not include p-values that were misreported as too high (_e.g._ _p_ = 1.0 instead of _p_ = .10) or as possible p-values (_e.g._ _p_ = .99 instead of _p_ = .099). However, @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2 found that only about .97% of non-significant p-values (defined as _p_ > .05) were misreported, and 1.56% of significant values. The dataset was then limited to only those p-values most likely to be reported as marginally significant (.05 < _p_ <= .1). According to @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2 the vast majority of researchers (94.3%) consider _p_ = .05 as significant, as such we limited our sample to _p_ > .05. In addition, @10.1177/0956797616645672, in an subanalysis of the distribution of p-values, report a sharp drop in p-values reported as marginally significant above _p_ = .1, and we therefore used as an upper limit _p_ <= .1. This resulted in a finished datset of 50,891 p-values, originating from 19,875 articles. Approximately 6.4% of all extracted p-values were thus between .05 and .1. Subsequently, missing metadata for 844 entries was retrieved from Crossref. Following this, journal names were standardized for all entries, with older journals names updated to their current (2017) APA-names, before adding subfield categories for each journal. Our categorization of journals into different subfields is taken from the APA's ([www.apa.org](www.apa.org)) divison of their journals into 'topics'. Note, however, that the APA allows the possibility of a journal belonging to several subfields. A full list of which journals were included in which subfields can be found in appendix {1}. Finally, a stratified random sample (by journal) was taken from this finished dataset, containing approximately 6% of entries from each journal. Five journals were not included in this test-sample due to consisting of too few entries (4 or fewer). -->
