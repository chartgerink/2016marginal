@10.1177/0956797616645672 examined the incidence of articles reporting results as 'marginally' significant in psychology. They looked at the frequency of articles reporting at least one result as marginally significant or approaching significance, for articles from the journals 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental Psychology' (DP), and the 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology' (JPSP) for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. In total they extracted 1,535 articles, meant to "represent three major subfields of psychology: cognitive, developmental, and social" (p. 1037) over time. Pritschet et al. (2016) drew two conclusions: 1) the proportion of articles reporting results as marginally significant (or variations thereof) has risen considerably in all three journals from 1970 to 2010; 2) results from articles published in JPSP (representing social psychology) were more likely to be interpreted as marginally significant than articles in 'Cognitive Psychology' or 'Developmental Psychology' (representing their respective subfields/disciplines).

@10.1177/0956797616645672's two conclusions regarding the prevalence of 'marginally significant' results in psychology may be incorrect due to a confounding factor. Their outcome variable was the proportion of papers reporting one or more results as marginally significant. However, if an article contains more _p_-values, the probability increases that the article contains at least one result reported as marginally significant. Problematically, @10.1177/0956797616645672's outcome measure does not take into account the fact that the number of reported _p_-values per journal article has increased over the years, nor that articles in JPSP on average contain more _p_-values than those in (at least) 'Developmental Psychology' [@10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2]. Consequently,  newer articles will be more likely to contain at least one 'marginally significant' result than older articles. In fact, even if there had been a decrease in 'marginally significant' results, @10.1177/0956797616645672 could have found an increase. Similarly, articles in JPSP contain almost twice as many _p_-values as those in 'Developmental Psychology' [@10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2]. Hence, here too, even if the probability that a result is reported as marginally significant is lower in social psychology, @10.1177/0956797616645672 could have found an increase. Thus, using as the outcome variable the proportion of papers reporting at least one result as marginally significant provides little information on researchers' usage of the concept of marginal significance, both over time and across journals.

In the current paper we re-examine @10.1177/0956797616645672's claims that 'marginally significant' results have become more prevalent over time in the journals JPSP and DP, and that results are reported as marginally significant more frequently in JPSP than in DP. We choose these two journals because they are both published by the American Psychological Association (APA). We adapted the dependent variable (DV) to take into account the varying number of _p_-values between different years and different journals. As such, we look at the proportion of _p_-values reported as marginally significant across years and journals. More specifically, since @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2 report that a _p_-value of .05 is typically considered to be significant and @10.1177/0956797616645672 report that most of the 'marginally significant' _p_-values they examined were equal to .1 or below, we look at the proportion of _p_-values between .05 and .1 reported as marginally significant across years and disciplines. 

Whole parts of the scientific literature can be effectively examined using automated methods. Based on such automated methods several recent publications have successfully used extracted statistics to examine the scientific literature [e.g., @10.7717/peerj.1142; @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2; @10.1080/19312458.2015.1096333]. One of the most common automated methods is using so called regular expressions that search through the provided (article) text for pre-defined strings of text, the results of which are then saved to a data file for analysis. The more complex the data that need to be extracted gets, the more limited this method becomes. Fortunately, when solely extracting _p_-values only three things need be identified in the text: the '_p_', the comparison sign, and the value itself [see @10.1093/biostatistics/kxt007, and discussions in the same issue of Biostatistics for an extensive treatment on the extraction of _p_-values]. The advantage of automated methods when examining the scientific literature is that they permit collecting large samples of data. For example, @10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2, despite using a R-package ('statcheck') that only extracts complete APA-formatted test results (t-, F-values etc), collected 258,105 _p_-values from 30,717 articles published between 1985 and 2013. 

Using automated extraction of _p_-values, we first replicate and then extend @10.1177/0956797616645672. @10.1177/0956797616645672 examined the incidence of 'marginally significant' results in three journals: JPSP, DP and 'Cognitive psychology', meant to represent the psychological disciplines of social, developmental and cognitive psychology. They thus used only one journal to represent each discipline, and with data from only five years for each journal. Using automated extraction, we collect data from articles published between 1985 and 2016 in journals published by the APA. This permits us to examine @10.1177/0956797616645672's claims with data from up to 32 consecutive years per discipline, and with a number of journals making up each discipline, thus decreasing the risk of sampling bias and increasing precision of trend estimates. Moreover, it also allows us to examine the prevalence of 'marginally significant' results in APA-journals overall, and in six psychological disciplines beyond those explored by @10.1177/0956797616645672: Clinical psychology, educational psychology, experimental psychology, forensic psychology, health psychology, and organizational psychology.
